# Real-Estate-Price-Estimator
Objective: To estimate housing prices using regularized regression techniques (Ridge and Lasso) to reduce overfitting and improve generalization in predictions.
📌 Project Overview:
This estimator will analyze real estate data (area, location, amenities, etc.) and train
regression models to predict house prices. Regularization will help identify important features
and reduce model variance.
🎯 Project Features:
Load and preprocess housing data
Train Ridge and Lasso regression models
Compare model accuracy
Display feature importance and error metrics
Visualize predicted vs. actual prices
Project Phases:
📍 Phase 1: Setup
 Import pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn
 Load and encode dataset
📍 Phase 2: Modeling
 Fit Ridge and Lasso regression models
 Tune hyperparameters (alpha)
 Predict prices on test set
📍 Phase 3: Evaluation
 Calculate R², MAE, MSE
 Plot prediction vs. actual
 Analyze coefficients and regularization effects
